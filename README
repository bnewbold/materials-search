This is intended to be a learning/tutorial project to demonstrate the ThriftDB
search service using a publicly available dataset. 

A set of bash and/or python scripts will demonstrate the construction of a
ThriftDB bucket, parsing of the raw data into a schema, and upload to ThriftDB.
A simple command line python script will demonstrate searching. A simple static
HTML/JS web page will demonstrate fetching results remotely using via JSONP
(cross-domain JSON requests via callbacks).
